<h1>Campfire Safety & Leave No Trace Principles</h1>
<p>Campfires are a highlight of camping—but only if done safely and responsibly.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>UK Fire Laws:</b> Where fires are allowed, when a stove is better.</li>
  <li><b>Building a Safe Fire:</b> Fire pits/rings, clear debris, keep water nearby.</li>
  <li><b>Burning Responsibly:</b> Only dry wood; never burn rubbish or plastics.</li>
  <li><b>Leave No Trace:</b> Douse, scatter ashes, restore the area.</li>
  <li><b>Alternatives:</b> Use a portable stove—safer and often required.</li>
</ul>
