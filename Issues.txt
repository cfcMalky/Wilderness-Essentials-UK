product card images have been stretched to the width of the card but not stretched vertically so are out of ratio and part of the image is missing

some images are missing,   use the main image from each html product page (the ones for these are in tents-dome folder)

some of the links don't work,   use the ASINs from the product html files I added to create a clean amazon uk page link and add my affiliate tag 'mmc1983-21'
